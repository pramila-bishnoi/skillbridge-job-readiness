"""Idempotent demonstration seed.

Running this twice must not create a second copy of anything. That is achieved
by giving every seeded row a *stable, deterministic* natural key:

* jobs         – the ``job_code`` in ``seed/jobs.json`` (JOB-2026-0001 …)
* applications – ``APP-2026-S<nnn>``, derived from a fixed random seed
* admin        – the email address from ``ADMIN_EMAIL``

so each seed row is looked up first and only inserted when missing.

    python -m scripts.seed                          # jobs + admin + demo applications
    python -m scripts.seed --no-demo                # jobs + admin only
    python -m scripts.seed --reset-admin-password   # also set ADMIN_EMAIL's password
                                                    # to ADMIN_PASSWORD (recovery)
